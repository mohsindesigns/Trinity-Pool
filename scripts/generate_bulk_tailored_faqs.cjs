        {
          question: "Do cupping marks hurt or cause permanent discoloration?",

        },
        {
          question: "How is assisted stretching different from regular stretching?",

        },
        {
          question: "Is assisted stretch therapy painful?",

        },
        {
          question: "Why does restricted fascia cause chronic pain?",
          answer: "When fascia hardens due to stress or injury, it exerts excessive tensile pressure on nerves, blood vessels, and muscles, leading to chronic stiffness and referred pain."
        },
        {
          question: "What symptoms respond best to myofascial release?",

        },
        {
          question: "How does trigger point therapy release stubborn muscle knots?",
          answer: "Targeted digital compression temporarily slows blood supply to the knot, which upon release floods the area with fresh oxygen and nutrients, resetting muscle tone."
        },
        {
          question: "Why do trigger points cause pain in distant areas?",

          question: "How soon will I feel relief after trigger point therapy?",
