        question: "What is corrective movement therapy, and who is it for?",
        answer: "Corrective movement therapy looks at how you move. We may watch simple tasks and basic exercises. Sessions can include mobility work, stability drills, soft-tissue work, and guided movement. This approach may suit active adults with recurring stiffness or inefficient movement habits. We do not diagnose injuries or replace medical rehabilitation."
      },
      {
        question: "How is corrective movement therapy different from physical therapy?",
        answer: "Physical therapy is licensed healthcare. A physical therapist can assess and treat injuries. Physical therapists also help people recover after surgery or manage diagnosed health problems. Corrective movement work focuses on how you move, how soft tissue feels, and safe exercise cues. It does not diagnose conditions or replace medical care."
      },
      {
        question: "Can corrective movement therapy help recurring back pain or sciatica?",
        answer: "Research supports exercise for many people with chronic nonspecific low back pain. The best plan depends on the individual. Sciatica requires additional care because nerve pain can have different causes. We keep movement comfortable and avoid cure claims. New weakness, saddle numbness, or bladder changes require urgent medical care."
      },
      {
        question: "What happens at the first session, and what should I wear?",
        answer: "Expect a short conversation about your symptoms, goals, training, work habits, and movements that bother you. We may watch simple motions, use focused hands-on work, guide you through a few drills, and then retest your movement. Wear comfortable clothing that lets you squat, reach, bend, and move without feeling restricted during the session."
      },
      {
        question: "How many sessions will I need, and do I need a referral?",
        answer: "There is no fixed session count. Long-term stiffness, training load, pain history, and daily habits all matter. We retest your movement and plan the next visit based on how your body responds. You can contact 410 Muscle Therapy to discuss booking. New weakness, major trauma, or worsening nerve symptoms need medical care first."

      },
      {
        question: "How often should I book a sports massage?",
        answer: "There is no single research-based schedule that fits everyone. Session frequency depends on training load, soreness, goals, health history, budget, and how long the benefits last. Some clients book more often during demanding periods, then space visits farther apart. We adjust recommendations based on how your body responds over time."
      },
      {
        question: "Is sports massage safe for athletes?",
        answer: "Sports massage is generally well tolerated, but athletes should share information about recent injuries, surgery, fractures, a history of blood clots, blood-thinning medications, skin problems, or unusual nerve symptoms before treatment. If something suggests a medical issue, we may recommend medical clearance first. Safe care always starts with honest information and clear communication."
      },
      {
        question: "What should I do before and after my session?",
        answer: "Arrive normally hydrated and avoid a heavy meal right before your visit. Bring details about recent training, pain changes, injuries, and your next event. Wear or bring clothing that makes movement easy. Afterward, notice how you feel and avoid forcing intense exercise if the worked areas feel unusually sore."

        question: "Does infrared therapy hurt or use deep pressure?",
        answer: "Infrared therapy itself does not use massage pressure. Depending on the device, you may feel gentle warmth in the treated area. If hands-on work follows, pressure is adjusted to your comfort and tissue response. Deeper pressure is not always better, and effective bodywork should feel focused, controlled, and easy to discuss."
      },
      {
        question: "How is infrared therapy different from a spa massage?",
        answer: "The main difference is the goal. A spa massage usually centers on general relaxation. At 410 Muscle Therapy, we start with your pain pattern, movement limits, and muscle tension. Infrared support may be paired with targeted bodywork, giving each session a specific purpose instead of a generic relaxation routine."
      },
      {
        question: "How often should I book infrared therapy sessions?",
        answer: "No single schedule fits everyone. Research uses different devices, doses, wavelengths, and treatment plans, so frequency can vary. We look at your symptoms, goals, activity level, and response after each visit. Then we recommend a practical schedule instead of automatically pushing frequent sessions when you may not need them."
      },
      {
        question: "Is infrared therapy safe for athletes and active adults?",
        answer: "Research has examined photobiomodulation for muscle soreness, recovery, and athletic performance, although results can vary based on treatment timing, dose, and device. Active clients with recurring tightness or training-related soreness may also benefit from a Maryland sports massage therapist who can tailor hands-on care to training and recovery goals."
      },
      {
        question: "How should I prepare for my infrared therapy session?",
        answer: "Wear comfortable clothing and arrive ready to explain where symptoms start, what makes them worse, and what you have already tried. Tell your therapist about injuries, skin concerns, pregnancy, implanted devices, or medicines that may increase light sensitivity. Sharing these details helps us plan a safer, more comfortable session."

      {
        question: "What is fascial stretch therapy, and how is it different from stretching at home?",
        answer: "Fascial stretch therapy is practitioner-assisted stretching that uses supported positions, guided movement, and holds while you relax. Unlike stretching on your own, another person can control the angle and adjust tension as you respond. Research on stretching supports improved range of motion, while research specific to fascial methods is still growing."
      },
      {
        question: "Is fascial stretch therapy safe for sciatica and chronic back pain?",
        answer: "Stretching can support mobility and may ease some stiffness, but sciatica has different causes, and aggressive stretching is not right for everyone. We avoid forceful positions and sharp pain. New weakness, saddle numbness, or bladder or bowel changes require urgent medical assessment rather than massage or stretching care."
      },
      {
        question: "Is assisted stretching worth it if I already stretch at home?",
        answer: "It can be useful when you struggle to reach a position, relax into a stretch, or identify where movement is limited. A practitioner can support your body and adjust angles in real time. It is not automatically better than home stretching; its value depends on your goals, response, and consistency."
      },
      {
        question: "What does fascial stretch therapy cost, and is it covered by insurance?",
        answer: "Pricing can vary by session length and the services included, so current rates should be confirmed before booking. Insurance coverage also depends on your plan, provider type, and benefits. Ask 410 Muscle Therapy about current payment options, then check with your insurer if you plan to request reimbursement for bodywork."
      },
      {
        question: "What does a fascial stretch session feel like, and what should I wear?",
        answer: "Expect a supported stretch rather than a forceful pull. You may feel steady tension, pressure, or a strong stretch, but sharp pain is a reason to change position. Wear clothes that allow your hips, shoulders, and knees to move freely. You stay clothed, and your comfort guides the session throughout."

      {
        question: "What does a hot towel massage actually do for tight muscles?",
        answer: "Warm towels add gentle superficial heat before focused massage. That warmth may temporarily ease stiffness and help tense muscles feel more comfortable. The towel is not a cure by itself. At 410 Muscle Therapy, we use it to prepare tight areas for slower, more specific hands-on work and pressure."
      },
      {
        question: "Is hot towel massage better than hot stone massage for muscle tension?",
        answer: "Both treatments use heat, but they feel different. Warm towels provide soft, moist contact across a selected area, while heated stones hold warmth longer and may be placed or moved over the body. Warm towels may suit people who prefer gentler warming before focused muscle work and targeted pressure."
      },
      {
        question: "Can hot towel massage help recurring back, hip, or sciatica-related muscle tension?",
        answer: "Massage and warmth may help some people feel less tight when sciatica comes with guarded muscles around the lower back, hips, or glutes. They do not correct every cause of sciatic pain. New weakness, numbness, bladder or bowel changes, fever, trauma, or worsening pain need prompt medical evaluation."
      },
      {
        question: "How hot are the towels, and who should avoid heated massage?",
        answer: "Towels should feel comfortably warm, never painfully hot. Heat should be used with extra caution in people with reduced sensation, poor circulation, active inflammation, infection, open wounds, recent injuries, or certain ongoing medical conditions. Tell us about medications, pregnancy, recent procedures, and health concerns beforehand so we can decide whether heat should be modified."
      },
      {
        question: "How often should I book a hot towel massage for recurring muscle tightness?",
        answer: "There is no schedule that fits everyone. Frequency depends on your symptoms, activity, workload, goals, and response after each visit. Some clients schedule sessions around demanding training periods or particularly strenuous work weeks. Others return when tightness starts building again. We suggest follow-up timing based on how your body responds, not on a required membership schedule."

        question: "Is myofascial release good for chronic muscle pain?",
        answer: "Myofascial release may help some people dealing with ongoing muscle and soft-tissue discomfort, especially when tight tissue or trigger points affect movement. This focused hands-on approach uses slow, controlled pressure rather than quick rubbing. Results vary, but some people notice improvements in comfort, mobility, and how easily they move."
      },
      {
        question: "How is myofascial release different from deep tissue massage?",
        answer: "Deep tissue massage often uses firmer strokes and pressure through tight muscles. Myofascial release usually works more slowly on restricted fascia and tender areas. The goal is not simply to use stronger pressure. Instead, the work follows areas where tissue feels restricted, guarded, or uncomfortable during your assessment and session."
      },
      {
        question: "Can myofascial release help with sciatica symptoms?",
        answer: "It may help when muscle tension around the lower back, glutes, or hips contributes to discomfort. However, sciatica can also result from irritation or compression of a spinal nerve. Myofascial release cannot address every possible cause. New weakness, severe numbness, or bowel or bladder changes require prompt medical evaluation before massage therapy."
      },
      {
        question: "What should I expect during my first session?",
        answer: "Your first visit begins with a short conversation about your discomfort, movement, daily activities, and goals. We then check areas that feel tight or restricted and use slow pressure within your comfort level. After the hands-on work, we recheck movement and discuss practical next steps based on how your body responded."
      },
      {
        question: "How often should I book myofascial release sessions?",
        answer: "There is no single schedule that works for everyone. Visit frequency depends on how long your symptoms have been present, your activity level, your goals, and how your body responds. Some clients begin with more frequent sessions and then space visits farther apart as movement and comfort improve."

        answer: "Research suggests acupressure may help some people with pain, including low back pain, but results vary. Muscle work may also help ease tight neck, shoulder, hip, or glute tissue. Sciatica can involve nerve irritation or compression, so pressure point massage Maryland care should support, not replace, proper medical evaluation."
      },
      {
        question: "Does acupressure hurt, and how much pressure is used?",
        answer: "Good acupressure should feel purposeful, not punishing. Tender points may feel sore or intense for a moment, but sharp, burning, electric, or worsening pain is a reason to speak up. We adjust depth, angle, and timing throughout your session so pressure stays within a level you can handle comfortably."
      },
      {
        question: "Who should avoid acupressure or ask a doctor first?",
        answer: "Tell us before treatment if you are pregnant, take blood thinners, have a bleeding disorder, have had recent surgery, or have fractures, open wounds, skin infections, or other medical conditions. Massage is generally low risk when used appropriately, but forceful pressure may not be suitable in some situations. Medical clearance may be wise first."
      },
      {
        question: "How many sessions will I need, and what happens afterward?",
        answer: "There is no universal schedule for acupressure. Your visit frequency depends on your symptoms, activity, goals, and response to treatment. As your needs change, we may also suggest [Maryland stretch therapy](/maryland-fascial-stretch-therapy/) when improving flexibility and comfortable movement would support your progress."

        question: "Does cupping help chronic muscle pain and tightness?",
        answer: "Research suggests dry cupping may help reduce some types of musculoskeletal pain and improve soft tissue flexibility, especially in the short term. Results differ from person to person. We use cupping as focused bodywork for tight, sore areas rather than promising that it can cure every cause of ongoing pain."
      },
      {
        question: "Can cupping help sciatica or low back pain?",
        answer: "Research suggests cupping may help some people manage low back pain. Sciatica is different because irritation of the sciatic nerve can have several causes. Cupping may help relax tight muscles around the lower back and hips, but persistent numbness, weakness, or severe nerve pain should be medically evaluated."
      },
      {
        question: "Is cupping safe, and are marks normal?",
        answer: "Cupping is generally considered low risk when performed properly, and temporary circular marks are common after treatment. It should not be applied over broken or infected skin. Tell your therapist about blood thinners, bleeding conditions, pregnancy, skin problems, or recent medical procedures before your session."
      },
      {
        question: "How many cupping sessions will I need?",
        answer: "There is no single number of sessions that works for everyone. Your needs depend on how long the problem has been present, what keeps irritating the area, and how your body responds. Some people notice improvement after one visit, while long-term tension may benefit from repeated care."
      },
      {
        question: "How is cupping different from deep tissue massage?",
        answer: "Cupping and [deep tissue massage Maryland](/deep-tissue-massage-maryland/) work in different ways. Deep tissue massage uses focused pressure through muscles and connective tissue, while cupping creates a lifting effect with suction. Because each approach affects tight tissue differently, we may combine them when your symptoms, comfort, and goals support both."

      {
        question: "Does hot stone massage hurt, and how hot should the stones feel?",
        answer: "No. The stones should feel clearly warm, never burning, and focused pressure should not feel sharp. Stone temperature, placement, timing, and your heat sensitivity all matter. Tell us immediately if the warmth feels too strong. We can lower the temperature, move a stone, or switch to hands-only work right away."

        question: "Who should avoid hot stone massage or talk with a doctor first?",

Tell your therapist about blood-clot risk, reduced sensation, skin problems, injury, illness, or other health concerns. Some symptoms require medical evaluation rather than massage. New weakness, numbness, or changes in bladder or bowel function should be checked by a medical professional right away."

        question: "How much pressure should deep tissue massage use?",
        answer: "Deep tissue massage can feel somewhat uncomfortable, especially in areas that have been tight for a long time. However, it should not feel sharp, burning, numb, or unbearable. More pressure is not necessarily better. We check in with you throughout your session and adjust the pressure as needed, so you never have to grit your teeth and tolerate unnecessary discomfort."
      },
      {
        question: "How is pain-focused massage different from spa massage?",
        answer: "Spa massage often focuses primarily on general relaxation. With pain-focused massage, we spend more time working on the muscles and areas of tension related to what is bothering you. The goal is different. We do not diagnose medical conditions, but we pay close attention to areas where your muscles and soft tissues feel tight, tender, or restricted."
      },
      {
        question: "How often should I book deep tissue massage sessions?",
        answer: "There is no single schedule that works for everyone. Some people benefit from more frequent sessions at first, while others do better with more time between appointments. The right frequency depends on how long the issue has been bothering you, your activity level, how your body responds to treatment, and what you want to address."
      },
      {
        question: "Is deep tissue massage safe for athletes?",
        answer: "For many healthy athletes, deep tissue massage can be a useful part of a recovery routine when the pressure and timing are appropriate. Before your session, tell us about any recent injuries, swelling, bruising, numbness, surgery, concerns about blood clots, or medications you are taking. If deeper work is not appropriate that day, we can adjust the session and use a gentler approach."
      },
      {
        question: "How should I prepare for my session?",
        answer: "You do not need to do anything complicated before your session. Arrive a few minutes early, wear something comfortable, and tell us about any injuries, medications, surgeries, or health concerns. During the session, speak up about pressure, temperature, positioning, or anything else that does not feel right."
