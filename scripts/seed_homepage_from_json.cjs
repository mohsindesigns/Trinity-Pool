We start at a level of pressure within your comfort zone and then adjust as the tissue responds.

            q: "How much pressure should I expect during treatment?",
            a: "The pressure should feel firm but not sharp or burning. It should not be difficult to breathe through due to the pressure. We start at a level of pressure within your comfort zone and then adjust as the tissue responds. If you do not like something, feel numb, dizzy, or experience any sudden symptoms, unusual symptoms, or pain, tell us.

            question: "How is this different from a relaxation spa massage?",
            answer: "A spa massage usually focuses on relaxation and broad, soothing strokes. A performance recovery specialist Timonium starts with your symptoms, movement limits, activity demands, and pressure preferences. The session targets specific soft tissue restrictions while checking your response. Relaxation may happen, but practical comfort and movement guide the plan.",

            question: "How often should I schedule recovery sessions?",
            answer: "The right schedule depends on your symptoms, training load, goals, budget, health history, and response after each visit. Some clients begin weekly during a difficult period, then space appointments farther apart. Others book around demanding workouts or events. We review progress instead of placing everyone on one fixed plan.",

            answer: "The risk with massage when done correctly is lower. However, your condition will dictate the timing and pressure. You need to fill us in on any recent injuries, swelling, bruising, surgeries, any medications that affect your blood, numbness, and any medical concerns. Massage should not be done on any trauma that is still acute, pain that is severe, weakness, or any other neurological concerns until they have been evaluated by a proper medical professional.",
