      },
      {
        question: "How is performance bodywork different from traditional massage?",
        answer: "Performance bodywork goes beyond relaxation. We focus on diagnosing movement restrictions, releasing tight fascial layers, deactivating trigger points, and re-educating movement patterns so pain doesn't return."
      },
      {
        question: "How many sessions will I need to see results?",
        answer: "Most clients experience significant pain relief and mobility gains in their very first session. For chronic issues or athletic performance goals, a series of 3 to 6 sessions is typically recommended."
